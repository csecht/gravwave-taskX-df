# Sets variables for use by taskXDF and taskXDFt bash scripts. Place -cfg in same folder as scripts.

## HEADS UP: Intended only for AMD cards. 
## Things will go wrong if NVIDIA or other cards are also active.

#  Four X variables, as concurrent task multiples, are used to assign gpu_usage factors in
#    app_config.xml for the boinc-client. 
#  Comment out the task factors you do not want to use. 
#  Values may be changed, but must be non-zero integers.
#  Script will give best GPU task performance over time if X values are consecutive by 1.
#  Generally, the more memory a card has, the higher task X it can handle.

#  Modulo for number of minutes between status reports.
#  mod value:  1   2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9   <- Use one of these values.
#  n per hr:   60  30	20	15	12	10	8	7	6   <- Rate at which status logs are issued.
#    ...assuming the .timer script is running on a 60 sec interval.
#    Set mod to 1 to have a status report issued every time the main script is executed.

#  Report interval will issue a current status report every n script cycles.
#  Default is 5.

#  Upper limit of GPU card's VRAM% (integer) to trigger decrementing the task multiple.
#  Default value is 95. The suggested range is 90-98.

#  Lower limit of VRAM% (integer) that triggers a script pause needed to update VRAM% readings.
#  Recommended: use VRAM% required to run the lowest DF task (GB for DF 0.10 / GB card total)
#  Suggested values: 9 for 4 GB card, 7 for 6 GB card, 6 for 8 GB card.
#  Adjust as needed to minimize unnecessary pauses. 

vpct_min=9


#  Upper limit of a card's GTT% that triggers suspension of boinc project tasks 
#    or a script pause needed to update GTT% readings.
#  Use a value, based on observations, under which GTT% doesn't rapidly increase
#    once VRAM% usage nears its limit.
#  **Value (integer or float) depends on GPU VRAM memory -AND- total system memory.**
#  Suggested values: between 2 and 8

#  Time interval in seconds (integer or float) to pause script.
#  Is sometimes used in script with a sleep_factor multiplier. Some default uses:
#   As is or as ($sleep_t * 2) to suspend boinc in response to excessive GTT%.
#   As ($sleep_t * 4) to await VRAM% to rise above set minimum, vpct_min,
#     following a boinc resumption or start of a new task.
#   As (sleep_t * 6) after a task X change to let system equilibrate before next script cycle.
#  Default is 10 sec.

#  Set to 'yes' if you want to activate automatic abort of a task is is taking too long to run.
#  Default is 'no'. Auto-suspend will run in monitor-only mode.

auto_suspend=yes


#  Maximum time, in whole non-zero minutes (no decimals), for a task to run before triggering a notice
#    (or auto-suspend, if activated) for a long-running task.
#  Length should account for your maximum task multiple times longest observed single task time for your system.
