# gravwave-taskX-df
Scripts to automatically adjust concurrency of E@H gravitational wave tasks running on AMD GPUs. Can also be used to just monitor status of BOINC GW tasks.

These taskXDF bash shell scripts are for Linux systems with one or more AMD GPUs running Einstein@Home gravitational wave GPU tasks (O3AS) through BOINC. Supported AMD GPUs are Ellesmere, Polaris, Vega, or Navi. nVIDIA cards are not currently supported. The program will work in mixed GPU task queues with Gamma Ray (FGRPB1G) tasks. Other task apps have not been tested.

The package consists of the files, taskXDF, taskXDF-timer, and taskXDF.cfg. All files should be run from within the same directory.

The package monitors GPU memory usages and delta frequency (DF) values of current and pending tasks, then evaluates whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the task multiple for running concurrent tasks (task X). Changes to task X automatically are made by the script by changing the value of <gpu_usage> in the app_config.xml file. 

Script actions and metrics are reported to the terminal window and to a log file that the script generates, taskXDF.log. Default execution allows logging, but there is a command line option for no logging.

A file that tracks processed task names, currently_running_GWtasks.txt, is generated by the script in the script's parent directory; it should not be moved or deleted while the program is running (although nothing major will happen if you do.)

Script execution on timed intervals is controlled through the timer script, taskXDF-timer, which is run from the command line. A 1-and-done status report is available with the --status parameter entered as "taskXDF-timer --status" or "taskXDF --status". Changes to taskX can be avoided while still running timed intervals by setting "monitor_only=yes" in the taskXDF.cfg configuration file.

Additional user-specified run parameters are set in taskXDF.cfg. This configuration file can be edited with any text editor and can be edited on-the-fly while the timer is running, which may be useful to optimize settings as GW tasks run. Read the file comments to understand the settings.

The timer script is executed with a time parameter argument in seconds; e.g., `~$ ./taskXD-timer 60`. 
Usage details can be read with `~$ ./taskXD-timer --help`

Additional details for use are provided in the comments of the scripts and .cfg text file. Please read through those before using to understand what's going on. 

These scripts are written in bash ver.5.

Successful execution will display like this in the Terminal window:
```
$ ./taskXDF-timer 60
taskXDF-timer is executing taskXDF every 60 seconds; taskXDF reports every 20.0 minutes.
The reporting interval is set in the taskXDF.cfg file.

NOTES and TIPS:
To run the main script through the timer script and avoid the need to provide authentication to edit <gpu_usage> you may want to share permissions of app_config.xml between you and boinc:
```
~$ sudo usermod -a -G $LOGNAME boinc
~$ sudo usermod -a -G boinc $LOGNAME
```
then check with:
```
~$ groups boinc
~$ groups $LOGNAME
```

After adding yourself to the boinc group, a system reboot is needed for the new permissions to take effect.
Check that the boinc group has write permission for the app_config.xml file, e.g.:

`-rw-rw-r-- 1 boinc boinc 1523 Aug 23 08:02 /var/lib/boinc-client/projects/einstein.phys.uwm.edu/app_config.xml`

You will need to manually launch the timer script on each machine reboot.
To keep taskX adjustments responsive to changing DFs of GW tasks, use a 60 second time interval argument when launching the timer script.

Rarely, a GPU card running gravitation wave tasks will lose compute ability, thus
delaying progress and, hours later, either time-out or exit with a 
computation error. By default, this script provides a warning when a task takes 
more than 40 minutes to complete. This time can be reset in the taskXDF.cfg file. 
Check that this limit is reasonable for your system.
There an option in taskXDF.cfg to not suspend a too-long task; the default setting is
auto_suspend=yes, which can be changed to auto_suspend=no.
