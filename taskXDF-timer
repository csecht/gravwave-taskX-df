# This interval timer script executes taskXDF in the same folder.
# To avoid having to provide a password to edit the app_config.xml file,
#   make yourself a member of the boinc permissions group. $ sudo usermod -a -G boinc yourusername
#   and be sure that the boinc group has write permission to the app_config file:
#    -rw-rw-r-- 1 boinc boinc 1523 Aug 23 08:02 /var/lib/boinc-client/projects/einstein.phys.uwm.edu/app_config.xml
#  After adding yourself to the boinc group, a system reboot is needed for the new permissions to take effect.

# Running a timer script can sidestep the need for setting up a systemd .service and .timer,
#   but you will need to manually launch this timer script after each reboot.
# TIP: Run taskXDF-timer on a 60 sec interval to get responsive task X changes.

# Need to read $mod and log path, then create .log in case it is not present.
