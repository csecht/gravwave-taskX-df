# This interval timer script executes taskXDF in the same folder.
# To avoid having to provide a password to edit the app_config.xml file,
#   make yourself a member of the boinc permissions group. $ sudo usermod -a -G boinc yourusername
#   and be sure that the boinc group has write permission to the app_config file:
#    -rw-rw-r-- 1 boinc boinc 1523 Aug 23 08:02 /var/lib/boinc-client/projects/einstein.phys.uwm.edu/app_config.xml
#  After adding yourself to the boinc group, a system reboot is needed for the new permissions to take effect.

# Running a timer script can sidestep the need for setting up a systemd .service and .timer,
#   but you will need to manually launch this timer script after each reboot.
# TIP: Run taskXDF-timer on a 60 sec interval to get responsive task X changes.

    A time interval, in seconds, for running the taskXDF-timer script is required

    e.g., $0 60
    Values less than 60 will be converted to 60. Decimal seconds are invalid.

    Optional arguments: --header --status --monitor --help
        --header provides explanation of types of interval data reported; no interval time needed.
        --status provides current boinc and GPU run metrics; does not change task X.
        --help brings up this message.

    This timer script provides continuous timed runs of the taskXDF bash script.

    A time interval of 0 (zero) provides a one-off status report from $target,
        otherwise a non-zero interval time provides interval reports and taskX adjustments.

    Supported AMD GPUs: Ellesmere, Polaris, Vega, or Navi that are running
        Einstein@Home O3AS gravitational wave GPU tasks.
    Script WILL NOT WORK properly if CPU tasks are queued.

    A log file of Terminal output is created in the current folder.

    Numerous script run parameters can be configured in the taskXDF.cfg text file.
